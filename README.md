iPhone Bootcamp
===============

iPhone Bootcamp is an intense 6-hour, 1-day project-based approach to getting started with iPhone development.

Contact Jeremy Lightsmith for more info @ jeremy.lightsmith@gmail.com.

Format
------

We'll divide the day into about 3 equal parts and spend each on one of the projects below.  We'll talk about the concepts that each project introduces and even show you what implementing it looks like.  Then its on your own to really get it "into your fingers".

We'll be with you all the way.  To help you really rocket through all these examples.

Projects
--------

### Hello World

This is a simple app, just to get started.  It's a label with a couple buttons that change it's color.

This project will introduce you to:

- Objective-C
- XCode
- Interface Builder
- Buttons
  - wiring up actions to do something
- Labels
  - changing the state of view objects from code

### Favorite Websites

This app will show a list of your 3 or 4 favorite websites and allow you to go to them from the app.

It's an example to practice what we just learned w/ Hello World.  It also will let us explore the 2 controllers you'll probably spend most of your iPhone time using, NavigationViewController & TableViewController.

This project will introduce you to:

- NavigationViewController
- TableViewController
- WebkitViewController

### Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a simple game that will give us an opportunity to dive into some of the more advanced things that you'll also probably need to do.

We'll give you some code that's already started and let you dive into just the storage and networking parts of it.

This project will introduce you to:

- Storage w/ Sqlite
- Networking
